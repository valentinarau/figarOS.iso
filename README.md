# figarOS Operative System

### Welcome human!
You have been chosen to be part of our small community. This is a BETA test of the pioneer OS of the new era. <br> 
One day cats and robots will take control of the world, but you are safe with us (as long as you follow our instructions). <br>

### About
This is an open-source OS made with Wollok and some python code. Its is simple, but its all humans need, you dont need any more that that. <br>
It has several features such as different soundtracks and an aesthetic vibe to chill while we sh** on Windows. <br>
